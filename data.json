We have a company goal to extend the brand to a small brick and mortar location and a mobile unit that will both heavily utilize web and app technology to efficiently drive daily traffic to maintain the highest level of quality of our menu selections. Each extension of Reservations will offer brand familiar menu items while also providing different culinary experiences at various functions.  We believe that creating a strong brand will allow for cross marketing between each extension while also reducing the potential for over saturation.",
